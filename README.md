This repository contains the files required for the Data Products course project. The goal of the project is:

2. To prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about this application.

The code used for the Shiny application can be found under: [https://github.com/harborviewtech/Week_4_Assignment_ShinyApp](https://github.com/harborviewtech/Week_4_Assignment_ShinyApp).

The application is available online under the following link: [https://adugna-kelkay.shinyapps.io/week_4_assignment_shinyapp/](https://adugna-kelkay.shinyapps.io/week_4_assignment_shinyapp/).
