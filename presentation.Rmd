## Body Mass Index Calculation

This is a presentation on shiny app based on Coursera assignment for "Developing Data Products" course.

## The app consists of

- Requesting inputs
- Calculating BMI
- Ploting the BMI

## How BMI is Calculated

This is a simple calulation of BMI based on weight and height inputs.
```{r echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
defaulltWeight <- 150
defaultHeight <- 5
bmi <- defaulltWeight / (defaultHeight ^ 2) 
bmi
```

## Plot BMI

```{r }
plot(0:30, 0:30, type = "n")
points(bmi, bmi, col = "red", pch=19)

```
